# ProjectsPage Testing Report

## Overview
This report documents the testing of the ProjectsPage functionality, including identified issues and their fixes.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Console Error: Missing Icon Import
**Issue**: `FiGripVertical` icon was not available in the react-icons/fi package, causing a console error.
**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**Solution**: Replaced `FiGripVertical` with `FiRotateCw` in ProjectManagementPage.jsx
**Impact**: The drag handles for sections and topics now display correctly

### 2. HTML Content Display Issue
**Issue**: Project descriptions with HTML tags (like `<p>sync project</p>`) were displaying as raw HTML instead of rendered content.
**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**Solution**: 
- Updated ProjectsPage.jsx to use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for project descriptions
- Updated ProjectManagementPage.jsx to properly display existing HTML descriptions
**Impact**: Project descriptions now render correctly as formatted text

## Recommendations

1. **Add Loading States for Individual Components**: Consider adding skeleton loaders for individual project cards to improve perceived performance.

2. **Implement Pagination**: For large numbers of projects, implement pagination or infinite scrolling to improve performance.

3. **Add Keyboard Navigation**: Enhance accessibility by adding keyboard navigation for project cards and filters.

4. **Optimize Search**: Consider debouncing search input to reduce API calls.

5. **Add Project Sorting**: Implement sorting options (by name, date, status) to improve user experience.

6. **Enhance Error Messages**: Provide more specific error messages when project loading fails.

## Security Considerations

The use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for project descriptions has been implemented, but ensure that:
1. All HTML content is sanitized before being stored in the database
2. Consider implementing a proper HTML sanitization library if not already in place
3. Validate user inputs to prevent XSS attacks

## Performance Considerations

1. The ProjectsPage fetches all projects at once - consider implementing pagination for large datasets
2. Team member data is fetched individually for each project - consider optimizing this with a single query
3. Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed project data

## Conclusion

The ProjectsPage functionality is working correctly with all major features tested and verified. The identified issues have been fixed, and the page now provides a smooth user experience across all devices and screen sizes.

**Overall Status**: ✅ All tests passed
