## 🎯 Best Practices Implemented

1. **Error Handling:** All notification calls are wrapped in try-catch blocks to prevent failures from affecting core functionality
2. **Non-blocking:** Notifications are created asynchronously and don't block the main operation
3. **Graceful Degradation:** If notification creation fails, the main operation still completes successfully
4. **Appropriate Expiry:** Different notification types have appropriate expiry times:
   - Leave/Timesheet: 7 days
   - Projects/Sprints: 14 days
   - Achievements: 30 days
5. **Team Visibility:** Notifications respect team boundaries for privacy
6. **User Context:** Notifications include relevant user context (names, roles) for clarity

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Ready for Implementation (Helper Functions Exist)
1. **Timesheet Submission Notifications** - Use `notifyTimesheetSubmission` when timesheet component is updated
2. **Task Comments** - Add notifications for new comments on tasks
3. **Task Dependencies** - Notify users when dependent tasks are completed

### Suggested Additional Features
1. **Email Notifications** - Integrate with email service for important notifications
2. **Push Notifications** - Browser push notifications for urgent updates
3. **Notification Preferences** - Allow users to customize notification settings
4. **Digest Mode** - Daily/weekly notification summaries
5. **Mobile Notifications** - Integration with mobile app notifications

## 📝 Developer Notes

### Adding New Notifications

1. **Create Helper Function** in `src/utils/notificationHelper.js`:
```javascript
export const notifyNewFeature = async (userId, featureDetails) => {
  try {
    await supabase.from('announcements').insert({
      title: 'New Feature',
      content: `Feature details: ${featureDetails}`,
      created_by: userId,
      team_id: null, // or specific team
      expiry_date: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString()
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating notification:', error);
  }
};
```

2. **Import and Use** in the relevant component:
```javascript
import { notifyNewFeature } from '../utils/notificationHelper';

// In your function:
try {
  await notifyNewFeature(userId, details);
} catch (notificationError) {
  console.error('Notification failed:', notificationError);
  // Continue with main operation
}
```

3. **Always wrap in try-catch** to prevent notification failures from affecting core functionality
