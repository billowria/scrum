### Step 1: Initialize Team Conversations

Go to your **Supabase SQL Editor** and run:

```sql
SELECT initialize_team_conversations();
```

This creates chat rooms for all your existing teams.

**Verify it worked:**
```sql
SELECT c.name, c.type, COUNT(cp.user_id) as members
FROM chat_conversations c
LEFT JOIN chat_participants cp ON c.id = cp.conversation_id
WHERE c.type = 'team'
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.type;
```

You should see your team chat rooms listed!
